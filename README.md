# Productivity in Tech Flask Application

## Installation
In order to install all of the requirements for production & testing use the requirements.txt file. 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Webframework
This site is built using Flask

### Database Requirements
I utilize Mongodb being referenced by pymongo.

~~### AWS
Productivity in Tech.com Currently Uses Amazon Web Services. For this reason `app/aws.py` exists.
You will need to install the AWS Client and Setup your Configuration. Use http://aws.amazon.com/cli/ for installation instructions. 
Boto3 has been included in our `requirements.txt` file.~~ [Podcast will not be linked to s3 and will rely on knowing the manual title and url of the file.]
