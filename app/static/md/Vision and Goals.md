## The Values of Productivity in Tech
### Resourceful
***We Want to Help You, not just Answer Your Question***

We either have the answer to your productivity question or access to someone that will through our network of professionals.

We also encourage the sharing of information with affordable resources so anyone hoping to become more productive actually can.

### Friendly
***No one should be embarrassed for not knowing something.
No one should feel like they don't belong.***

We teach and empower community members through empathy and compassion and provide a safe place to learn and be involved.

### Professional
***No One Should Deny the Value we Bring to our Members***

There is something about being professional in the things that you do and provide. We don't take the task of helping others lightly. We strive to make sure that our content is accurate, valuable, and inspiring.

### Open
***We have NOTHING to hide***

We operate in full transparency from our income to our systems. Helping others comes with a cost but we still believe that others should be able to as well. Our sites and systems are open source and only the content itself is protected.
