Productivity in Tech is focused on the idea that we can best learn to be productive if we learn from each other. It was founded February 2016 with the [Productivity in Tech Podcast](/podcast) by [Jay Miller](#). It continues to grow into a friendly environment for people in the "Technology" space to talk about the app, tools, tips, and tricks they use to become more productive.
